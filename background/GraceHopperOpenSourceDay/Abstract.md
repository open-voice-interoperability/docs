Title: Developing Interoperable Conversational Assistants with the Open Voice Interoperability Initiative Specifications and Sandbox

Abstract: The goal of the Open Voice Network Interoperability Initiative of the LFAI and Data Foundation is to enable different voice and conversational AI systems to work together through the use of a standard open-source messaging protocol.
This session will describe the messaging protocol and introduce the Interoperability Sandbox implementation of the protocol. The messages will enable any conversational assistant that follows the standards to freely interoperate with other standards-using assistants to connect, communicate, and transfer content and control across assistants, platforms, and language models. Attendees will learn about the sandbox github repository (at https://github.com/open-voice-interoperability/open-voice-sandbox), how to use the sandbox, and get some ideas for initial contributions that they can make to the software.
